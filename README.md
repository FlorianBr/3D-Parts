# 3D-Parts

A collection of 3D printed parts I designed. The parts are either designed with OpenSCAD (the .scad files) or FreeCAD (the .FCStd files) but I usually also commit the exported STLs.

## 30x30 Profile Hinge Fix

Fixation for 30x30 aluminum profile hinges. The hinges I've got cannot really handle a lot, so I designed these thingys to fix the profiles in position.

## 30x30 Profile Lock

A lock I designed for the rack in my Volkswagen Caddy. Designed for Item 30x30 aluminum profiles but will probably work with others too.

##  Wurkos TS21 Clip

A wall-mounted clip for a Wurkos TS21 LED flashlight. I screwed it to a 30x30 profile, but its not limited to these profiles
